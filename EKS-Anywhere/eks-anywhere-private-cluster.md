# How to create a Private EKS-Anywhere cluster (Airgapped) with no outbound connectivity?

## Resources
- [EKS-A Airgapped](https://anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/docs/getting-started/airgapped/)
- [Registry Mirror](https://anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/docs/getting-started/optional/registrymirror/)

## Pre-Requisites
- Configure local registry mirror. The following projects must be created in your registry before importing the EKS Anywhere images:
    - bottlerocket
    - eks-anywhere
    - eks-distro
    - isovalent
    - cilium-chart
- An existing Admin machine.
    - Docker running on the Admin machine
    - At least 80GB in storage space on the Admin machine to temporarily store the EKS Anywhere images locally before importing them to your local registry. Currently, when downloading images, EKS Anywhere pulls all dependencies for all infrastructure providers and supported Kubernetes versions.
    - The download and import images commands must be run on an amd64 machine to import amd64 images to the registry mirror.

## Let's get going

- Download the EKS Anywhere artifacts that contain the list and locations of the EKS Anywhere dependencies. A compressed file `eks-anywhere-downloads.tar.gz` will be downloaded. You can use the eksctl anywhere download artifacts `--dry-run` command to see the list of artifacts it will download.

```
#eksctl anywhere download artifacts
```

- Decompress the eks-anywhere-downloads.tar.gz file using the following command. This will create an `eks-anywhere-downloads` folder.

```
#tar -xvf eks-anywhere-downloads.tar.gz
```

- Download the EKS Anywhere image dependencies to the Admin machine. This command may take several minutes (10+) to complete. To monitor the progress of the command, you can run with the `-v 6` command line argument, which will show details of the images that are being pulled. Docker must be running for the following command to succeed.

```
#eksctl anywhere download images -o images.tar

- Import images to the local registry mirror

- Create the cluster

```
#eksctl anywhere generate clusterconfig eksaprivate --provider docker > eksaprivate.yaml
#eksctl anywhere create cluster -f eksaprivate.yaml --bundles-override ./eks-anywhere-downloads/bundle-release.yaml
