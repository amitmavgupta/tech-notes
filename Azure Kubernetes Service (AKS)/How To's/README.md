# AKS How To's

Step-by-step AKS provisioning guides.

## Scenarios covered
- Azure CNI flavors: base CNI, overlay, BYO CNI, Azure Linux, and Cilium-powered clusters (`aks_cluster_azure_cni*.md`, `aks_cluster_byocni*.md`).
- Specialized deployments: RDMA/Infiniband builds, ARM-based worker creation, ingress integration, and workload identity.
- Operations: identity integration, Konnectivity agents, add-ons/extensions, and troubleshooting commands such as `aks_invoke.md`.

## Usage
Each guide is written around Azure CLI snippets. Set subscription context, follow the numbered sections, and reuse any manifest links referenced throughout the documents.
