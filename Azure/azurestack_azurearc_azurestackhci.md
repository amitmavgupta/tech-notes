## Azure Stack

Azure Stack represents a significant breakthrough in cloud technology, offering a hybrid cloud platform that allows businesses to run Azure services within their own data center. This product is a miniaturized version of the public Azure, providing users with the power and flexibility of Azure's vast array of services but on their terms and timelines.

Azure Stack's design caters specifically to businesses that require the agility of cloud services but also need to keep some or all of their data on-premises for regulatory or operational reasons. It allows these organizations to enjoy the benefits of the cloud – such as scalability, speed, and cost-efficiency – while still complying with data sovereignty regulations and maintaining control over sensitive information.
