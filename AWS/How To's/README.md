# AWS How To's

Self-contained AWS CLI recipes and operational notes.

## Topics
- Compute and networking: `ec2-instance-name.md`, `bandwidth-per-ec2-instance.md`, `retrieve_ec2_region_metadata.md`.
- IAM and security: `detach_iam_policies_role.md`, `remove_iam_role.md`, `list-ipv4-prefixes.md`.
- Container services: `eks_ebs_driver.md`, `list_az_aws_region.md`, and helper docs for tagging or naming EC2 instances.
- Troubleshooting utilities: quick lookups such as `ec2-instance-id.md` and `list-secondary-ips.md`.

## Working with these guides
Every markdown file lists prerequisites, commands, and expected output snippets. Copy the commands directly or adapt them inside automation pipelines.
