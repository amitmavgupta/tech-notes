# Kubernetes

General-purpose Kubernetes manifests and how-to guides that are not tied to a specific cloud.

## Contents
- `How To's/`: CLI tricks, namespace cleanup, kubeadm/kind workflows.
- `Manifests/`: Sample workloads for canary testing, dual-stack services, iperf benchmarking, Windows nodes, and more.

Mix and match the guides with the manifests to prototype scenarios before porting them to a managed service.
