# Kubernetes Manifests

Reusable Kubernetes YAML for networking and workload experiments.

## Highlights
- Canary deployments and services for blue/green validation.
- Dual-stack service examples plus IPv4/IPv6-only manifest pairs.
- Performance and diagnostics workloads (`iperf*`, `pod-netshoot.yaml`, `windows_server_deployment.yaml`).

Apply with `kubectl apply -f <file>` and pair with the how-to docs for guided walkthroughs.
